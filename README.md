# TitanicPredictionModelling

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on the available information. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately determines whether a passenger survived or not.

# Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

•**README.md:** <p style="text-align:justify">This file provides an overview of the project and its instructions.<br><p>
•**modelling_main.ipynb:** <p style="text-align:justify">This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data preparation, cleaning, and prediction modelling.<br></p>
•**Titatnic_Data:** <p style="text-align:justify">This file includes two datasets in CSV format: the training dataset (train.csv) and the test dataset (test.csv). Both datasets serve specific purposes, with the training dataset used for training the model and the test dataset utilized for evaluating its performance. It is important to note that the same feature engineering and data preparation steps must be applied to both datasets to ensure consistency. However, within the project, we further split the training dataset into separate training and testing subsets.<br></p>
